### Aboa

Aboa is a multidisciplinary team of students from University of Turku and Ã…bo Akademi. We are participating in the [iGEM 2019 competition](http://igem.org/). Our team consists of 12 students with variety of backgrounds from medicine to economics.



We are improving immunological tests by incorporating a non-canonical amino acid to antibodies with expanded genetic code. With this amino acid we can orient antibodies correctly and increase the amount of available binding sites in the test surface.

Join us to make the world a more sensitive place!
