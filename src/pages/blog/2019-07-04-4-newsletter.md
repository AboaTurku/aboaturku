## **Laboratory** 

 Past couple of weeks we have faced some difficulties.

We have spent countless hours in the lab planning our next move and we eventually managed to achieve our goal: we got fluorescent colonies! This means we can finally continue to work towards our other targets.

## **Events**

Our access to a couple of events was confirmed! We are going to participate at least in Symposium and Shift, both held in August. In addition to these we are going to visit Helsinki, where AaltoHelsinki team will hold a conference for some other iGEM teams.
