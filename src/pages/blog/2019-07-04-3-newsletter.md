## **Hello!**

 

Lab work has now properly started since we managed to get most of the equipment and reagents that we need. Cell culturing is going well, which means that soon we can start to do the exciting stuff! We are also advertising our team and idea in all events possible, so this week a couple of our members participated in Life Science Live.

 

## **Life Science Live**

We conquered the Turun Messukeskus with enthusiasm and as a result got cheers and new contacts.
