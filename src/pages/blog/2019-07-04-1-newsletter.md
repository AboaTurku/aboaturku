## Hello,



we have now started writing newsletters to keep you updated on us and there is a lot to update on. First we would like to let you know that we had to change our team name from GemTurku to **Aboa**. However, our group association is still GemTurku ry.



## We are now officially registered to iGEM competition

We have now registered and paid the fee to the competition, so there is no going back. We are going to do this!



## We are in social media

You can find more about our journey from the social media:

instagram: @igem.aboa

twitter:@IGEM_Aboa

facebook: https://www.facebook.com/teamaboa/



## Web pages coming soon

Our web pages will be up and running soon.

## We got to know other Finnish participants

Luckily we are not the only team from Finland, since there is also one other team from Helsinki called Aalto-Helsinki. They invited us over the other day to get to know each other and have fun. More about our trip to Helsinki can be found in Instagram.







with best regards,

Janniina Karinsalo & Aboa
