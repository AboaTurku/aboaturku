## Hello,



now that the 1st of May has been properly celebrated, we are getting back to work. We are starting our laboratory work and planning for science education events. In addition to this, we are going to put up a stand in the Life Science Live affair in Turku on 15th to 16th May. Also, lots have been done and happened last month, so we’ll give you a short summary of some of the most important stuff.



## Our web pages are up and running

Yes, we now have our own website, where we have gathered some information about us, our project and else. We can be found at:

_https://aboaturku.fi/_



## SciCruise 2019

We taught children how to extract DNA from bananas in April during the SciCruise 2019. The yield was not determined, but we were happy with the results: children learning how science works in practise.





## Local publicity in Turun Sanomat

You can find the article of us in the print paper released on 20th April as “Opiskelijoiden diagnostiikan keksintö kovaan kilpailuun” in page 16, or in the electronic version as “Kultamitali haussa - turkulaisopiskelijat diagnostiikan keksinnöllä mukaan maailman suurimpaan synteettiseen tiedekilpaan".



## Laboratory spaces

We’re happy to tell you, that we got labspace from Medicity. Now we just need to equip it.



with best regards,

Janniina Karinsalo & Aboa
