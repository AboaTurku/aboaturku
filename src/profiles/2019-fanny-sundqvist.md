During the spring and summer of 2019 I along with my team members visited some of the companies (that we begged for money), met with the university rectors (and asked for more money), assisted with writing the research plan and sometimes popped into the lab to do some wet lab work. The rest of the time I tried to learn html (somewhat successfully) and apply those hard-earned skills towards making our team wiki look presentable.
